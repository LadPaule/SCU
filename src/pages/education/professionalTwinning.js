              SCU provides educational support to children through the generous
              support from sponsors. A sponsored child is availed with fees,
              basic health and feeding to ensure holistic growth and well-being
              of child while at school. Children also exchange written letters
              to their sponsors to express their gratitude and to know their
              sponsors on personal level. <br />

              Building Schools. Step out teams bless and get involved with
              communities in SCU through building schools. Many of these schools
              are poorly structured and very unconducive for learning but
              through the kindness and selfless gratitude of the step out teams;
              We get on ground and build better structures thereby ensuring that
              children study in enriched learning environments.

              Working together with our growing Church partners, we continue to
              take young people through a consistent long term discipleship
              program geared for their spiritual growth as they eventually
              become leaders in their own Church and/or communities. Most of
              them are in school so we meet during their holidays. <br />
              <br />
              We are never tiring in our endeavor and calling to always reach
              out to both new and old grounds as the Lord draws hearts to
              Himself through us. With the help of our sisters and brothers who
              continuously support us and where the Lord allows, some keep
              coming over for a boots-on-the-ground experience.
